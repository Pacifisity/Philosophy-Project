					"An ideology is a worldview, a set of interconnected values
					and rigid beliefs about what the world is or should be
					like—which guide people’s thinking and action.[4] Ideologies
					include Marxism, Christianity, Humanism, Islam, Nazism, and
					Liberal Democracy, among other political and religious
					worldviews."
				</p>
				<p class="response">
					Do any of these have substantial proof of their main
					teachings? I’m starting to draw a connection between
					ideologies and a lack of substantial proof.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="annotation">
				<p class="article">
					"One reason is that teaching students to believe ideologies
					might seem at odds with the educational aim of fostering
					intellectual virtues, such as open-mindedness, curiosity,
					and sensitivity to evidence."
				</p>
				<p class="response">
					Why aren’t other theories that are more scientifically
					aligned on there, can’t they also be considered an ideology
					under their own definition? Someone who is a pure atheist
					can also be considered close minded if they refuse to listen
					to religious reason.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="annotation">
				<p class="article">
					"For one, it’s hard to see how teaching without ideology is
					possible.[7] Teaching students why, e.g., democracy is just,
					is ideological in the sense that it promotes democratic
					ideology. If ideological instruction is indoctrination, so
					is mainstream civic education, since it too promotes
					ideologies. But civic education and indoctrination are
					different."
				</p>
				<p class="response">
					Alright, so the author recognizes that deficit as well.
					However, it still is referring to the political spectrum and
					not at all mentioning science as a possibility to be
					considered an ideology.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="annotation">
				<p class="article">
					"Proponents might reply by distinguishing ‘good’ from ‘bad’
					ideology: bad ideologies are false or unjustified beliefs;
					good ideologies are true or justified beliefs, and teaching
					bad ideology is indoctrination, whereas teaching good
					ideology is not."
				</p>
				<p class="response">
					I love the use of single quotes here, it suggests to me that
					the author had some strong thoughts about whoever suggested
					adding morals to the mix.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="annotation">
				<p class="article">
					"A promising method theory is the Rationality-Bypassing
					Theory. It says that indoctrination occurs when teachers get
					students to believe things without enabling them to
					rationally evaluate the beliefs."
				</p>
				<p class="response">
					I agree, especially if they know the student is unable to
					get their hands on resources to refute them. For someone
					with the goal of indoctrination, I imagine the first step is
					being sure they won’t ask too many questions.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="annotation">
				<p class="article">
					"The second is that it might be good to sometimes bypass
					students’ rationality: e.g., to help students acquire
					critical thinking skills, teachers must first get them to
					accept certain principles of reasoning without challenging
					them: debate can sometimes impede education."
				</p>
				<p class="response">
					When I read this, it reminded me of the “think like a 4 year
					old rule” where you say why to everything. Eventually that
					gets tiring and you just give up explaining because at some
					point you can’t give an empirical response.

					"This seems like a bad case of dogmatism. But some cases of
					dogmatism seem to be good: e.g., are people who dogmatically
					refuse to consider climate change denialism seriously doing
					something wrong?"
				</p>
				<p class="response">
					By their own definition of dogmatism, this IS wrong. They
					define dogmatism as “ignoring or dismissing relevant
					challenges to one’s beliefs.” If there is a substantial
					challenge, they should at least be open-minded to possible
					alternate theories.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="annotation">
				<p class="article">
					"If indoctrination is a matter of teaching ideology, it’s
					wrong when it misleads students. Ideologies often give fixed
					answers to questions for which reasonable people can
					disagree: e.g., being taught that God definitely exists (or
					definitely does not exist) misleads students because it
					suggests that reasonable people don’t deny it when they do."
				</p>
				<p class="response">
					Misleading is perspective based. One person might say you’re
					misleading someone while another is saying you’re a great
					teacher. I appreciate the author’s use of an accent.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="annotation">
				<p class="article">
					"Still, maybe that’s innocuous indoctrination because doing
					otherwise gives them the false impression that it’s part of
					a serious debate when it isn’t. Misleading people seems
					wrong, after all. Some beliefs are rightly accepted without
					considering the alternatives that some erroneously take
					seriously."
				</p>
				<p class="response">
					This can be seen in the argument of whether water is wet. It
					was treated as a serious argument built around a joke and
					ravaged regular conversation. It’s all up to the definition
					you use to define something as being wet.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="annotation">
				<p class="article">
					"Having a clearer understanding of indoctrination helps us
					to evaluate charges made against educators. It also helps us
					to evaluate why indoctrination is wrong, when it is. As
					we’ve seen, the answers aren’t straightforward."
				</p>
				<p class="response">
					I want examples of this, what are some situations where
					educators throughout history were charged with
					indoctrination? I know there was something related to
					Darwin’s theory of evolution, but that’s it.

					In the article it briefly mentions the connection between
					education and indoctrination but doesn’t dive as deep as
					this paper does. I feel that the connection between the two
					is very important to further study. This paper depicts the
					overlap between indoctrination and education, they are both
					methods of teaching. However, these resources specifically
					detail the difference in being able to question those
					beliefs and fostering open-mindedness. Things that are
					considered indoctrination can be easily brushed off as
					irrelevant to certain cultures, especially in relation to
					religion. They also mention that some types of education can
					already be considered indoctrination.

				<p class="response">
					Often indoctrination is related to blind belief. Being able
					to question those beliefs is used to split apart education
					and indoctrination. However, in the context of free it can
					be seen as a form of indoctrination of knowledge when
					accepted blindly. If someone believes that all human
					behavior is determined, then wouldn’t they never question
					free will? It’s a form of indoctrination because it creates
					an illusion that questioning certain behaviors is all
					determined. It creates a sort of loop, if I can’t think of
					anything myself then how can I be free and if I’m not free
					how can I question my beliefs? This doesn’t recognize
					compatibilism explicitly at all, although it uses the
					analogy of frustrators that can make choices within the
					system but ultimately still says that those choices were
					determined. The video was simplified and was missing many
					thoughts on free will.

					This article discusses the ongoing debate over changes made
					to their education system. Specifically on conflicts between
					changes for new thinking and addressing social issues and
					the other for traditional values and culture. Both believe
					that their view is correct and therefore would one side
					winning be considered a type of indoctrination. I believe
					that it will allow people to explore indoctrination not only
					as a way of rigid thinking, but also as a way of belief.
					There will always be discussion on right and wrong ways to
					do something and often it will never be clear cut but
					believing that there’s not a clear answer is also a rigid
					belief. Indoctrination isn’t as simple as finding a balance
					or choosing a side, it’s just about what works for you and
					never taking 100% of what someone says to be factual. The
					author seems to have some bias towards preservation of the
					current traditions. Often when talking about modern topics
					they will overgeneralize and give poor description of their
					terms. However, if you keep that in mind while reading then
					it will allow you to recognize subtle indoctrination and the
					lack of information, they give you to think critically and
					can also be a kind of exploration.

					Socrates argues that knowledge isn’t just correct opinions
					but being able to put those ideas into practice. This
					practice Socrates refers to can be considered the
					questioning part of indoctrination that many aren’t quite
					clear of. Socrates suggests that with his definition of
					“true knowledge” that education can still be considered
					indoctrination if the students are not allowed to put it
					into practice and make their own conclusions. They allow
					readers to make a distinction between objective truth and
					opinion. Often knowledge is subjective and/or relative based
					on different people’s perspectives. It is very easy to start
					a discussion on what knowledge or application are and if
					those are subjective. Especially in specific cultural
					contexts of how they describe knowledge.

			<h2>My Position</h2>
			<p>
				<!-- My view -->
				Indoctrination can be both a good and bad thing. We often
				receive the word in a negative connotation but some things don't
				benefit from thoroughly picking at every loose end. It's easiest
				to call it a bad thing when relating it to ideologies with very
				little evidence for or against either side. I believe this is
				because people want to hide their lack of evidence when trying
				to discuss their views.
