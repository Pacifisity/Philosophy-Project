					"An ideology is a worldview, a set of interconnected values
					and rigid beliefs about what the world is or should be
					like—which guide people’s thinking and action.[4] Ideologies
					include Marxism, Christianity, Humanism, Islam, Nazism, and
					Liberal Democracy, among other political and religious
					worldviews."
				</p>
				<p class="response">
					Do any of these have substantial proof of their main
					teachings? I’m starting to draw a connection between
					ideologies and a lack of substantial proof.

					"One reason is that teaching students to believe ideologies
					might seem at odds with the educational aim of fostering
					intellectual virtues, such as open-mindedness, curiosity,
					and sensitivity to evidence."
				</p>
				<p class="response">
					Why aren’t other theories that are more scientifically
					aligned on there, can’t they also be considered an ideology
					under their own definition? Someone who is a pure atheist
					can also be considered close minded if they refuse to listen
					to religious reason.

					"For one, it’s hard to see how teaching without ideology is
					possible.[7] Teaching students why, e.g., democracy is just,
					is ideological in the sense that it promotes democratic
					ideology. If ideological instruction is indoctrination, so
					is mainstream civic education, since it too promotes
					ideologies. But civic education and indoctrination are
					different."
				</p>
				<p class="response">
					Alright, so the author recognizes that deficit as well.
					However, it still is referring to the political spectrum and
					not at all mentioning science as a possibility to be
					considered an ideology.

					"Proponents might reply by distinguishing ‘good’ from ‘bad’
					ideology: bad ideologies are false or unjustified beliefs;
					good ideologies are true or justified beliefs, and teaching
					bad ideology is indoctrination, whereas teaching good
					ideology is not."

				<p class="response">
					I love the use of single quotes here, it suggests to me that
					the author had some strong thoughts about whoever suggested

					"A promising method theory is the Rationality-Bypassing
					Theory. It says that indoctrination occurs when teachers get
					students to believe things without enabling them to
					rationally evaluate the beliefs."
				</p>
				<p class="response">
					I agree, especially if they know the student is unable to
					get their hands on resources to refute them. For someone
					with the goal of indoctrination, I imagine the first step is
					being sure they won’t ask too many questions.
				</p>

			<div class="annotation">

					"The second is that it might be good to sometimes bypass
					students’ rationality: e.g., to help students acquire
					critical thinking skills, teachers must first get them to
					accept certain principles of reasoning without challenging
					them: debate can sometimes impede education."
				</p>
				<p class="response">
					When I read this, it reminded me of the “think like a 4 year
					old rule” where you say why to everything. Eventually that
					gets tiring and you just give up explaining because at some
					point you can’t give an empirical response.

					"This seems like a bad case of dogmatism. But some cases of
					dogmatism seem to be good: e.g., are people who dogmatically
					refuse to consider climate change denialism seriously doing
					something wrong?"
				</p>
				<p class="response">
					By their own definition of dogmatism, this IS wrong. They
					define dogmatism as “ignoring or dismissing relevant
					challenges to one’s beliefs.” If there is a substantial
					challenge, they should at least be open-minded to possible
					alternate theories.

					"If indoctrination is a matter of teaching ideology, it’s
					wrong when it misleads students. Ideologies often give fixed
					answers to questions for which reasonable people can
					disagree: e.g., being taught that God definitely exists (or
					definitely does not exist) misleads students because it
					suggests that reasonable people don’t deny it when they do."
				</p>
				<p class="response">
					Misleading is perspective based. One person might say you’re
					misleading someone while another is saying you’re a great
					teacher. I appreciate the author’s use of an accent.

			<div class="annotation">
				<p class="article">
					"Still, maybe that’s innocuous indoctrination because doing
					otherwise gives them the false impression that it’s part of
					a serious debate when it isn’t. Misleading people seems
					wrong, after all. Some beliefs are rightly accepted without
					considering the alternatives that some erroneously take
					seriously."
				</p>
				<p class="response">
					This can be seen in the argument of whether water is wet. It
					was treated as a serious argument built around a joke and
					ravaged regular conversation. It’s all up to the definition
					you use to define something as being wet.

					"Having a clearer understanding of indoctrination helps us
					to evaluate charges made against educators. It also helps us
					to evaluate why indoctrination is wrong, when it is. As
					we’ve seen, the answers aren’t straightforward."
				</p>
				<p class="response">
					I want examples of this, what are some situations where
					educators throughout history were charged with
					indoctrination? I know there was something related to
					Darwin’s theory of evolution, but that’s it.

        <p class="response">
          In the article it briefly mentions the connection between education
          and indoctrination but doesn’t dive as deep as this paper does. I feel
          that the connection between the two is very important to further
          study. This paper depicts the overlap between indoctrination and
          education, they are both methods of teaching. However, these resources
          specifically detail the difference in being able to question those
          beliefs and fostering open-mindedness. Things that are considered
          indoctrination can be easily brushed off as irrelevant to certain
          cultures, especially in relation to religion. They also mention that
          some types of education can already be considered indoctrination.

        <h3>Metaphysics: The Problem of Free Will</h3>
        <p class="response">
          Often indoctrination is related to blind belief. Being able to
          question those beliefs is used to split apart education and
          indoctrination. However, in the context of free it can be seen as a
          form of indoctrination of knowledge when accepted blindly. If someone
          believes that all human behavior is determined, then wouldn’t they
          never question free will? It’s a form of indoctrination because it
          creates an illusion that questioning certain behaviors is all
          determined. It creates a sort of loop, if I can’t think of anything
          myself then how can I be free and if I’m not free how can I question
          my beliefs? This doesn’t recognize compatibilism explicitly at all,
          although it uses the analogy of frustrators that can make choices
          within the system but ultimately still says that those choices were
          determined. The video was simplified and was missing many thoughts on
          free will.

          Two Imperatives in Education: Change of Culture v. Transmission of the
          Status Quo
        </h3>
        <p class="response">
          This article discusses the ongoing debate over changes made to their
          education system. Specifically on conflicts between changes for new
          thinking and addressing social issues and the other for traditional
          values and culture. Both believe that their view is correct and
          therefore would one side winning be considered a type of
          indoctrination. I believe that it will allow people to explore
          indoctrination not only as a way of rigid thinking, but also as a way
          of belief. There will always be discussion on right and wrong ways to
          do something and often it will never be clear cut but believing that
          there’s not a clear answer is also a rigid belief. Indoctrination
          isn’t as simple as finding a balance or choosing a side, it’s just
          about what works for you and never taking 100% of what someone says to
          be factual. The author seems to have some bias towards preservation of
          the current traditions. Often when talking about modern topics they
          will overgeneralize and give poor description of their terms. However,
          if you keep that in mind while reading then it will allow you to
          recognize subtle indoctrination and the lack of information, they give
          you to think critically and can also be a kind of exploration.

        <h3>Western Philosophy, an Anthology: Third Edition</h3>
        <p class="response">
          Socrates argues that knowledge isn’t just correct opinions but being
          able to put those ideas into practice. This practice Socrates refers
          to can be considered the questioning part of indoctrination that many
          aren’t quite clear of. Socrates suggests that with his definition of
          “true knowledge” that education can still be considered indoctrination
          if the students are not allowed to put it into practice and make their
          own conclusions. They allow readers to make a distinction between
          objective truth and opinion. Often knowledge is subjective and/or
          relative based on different people’s perspectives. It is very easy to
          start a discussion on what knowledge or application are and if those
          are subjective. Especially in specific cultural contexts of how they
          describe knowledge.

      <h2>Connection</h2>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <h3>W. K. Clifford</h3>
        <p>
          Indoctrination is closely linked with education, but more
          specifically; it’s taught “beliefs” or “ideologies.” Along the lines
          of belief, Clifford mentions something that resembles indoctrination
          and adds a moral right or wrong to the mix. He says “The question of
          right or wrong has to do with the origin of his belief, not the matter
          of it; not what it was, but how he got it; not whether it turned out
          to be true or false, but whether he had a right to believe on such
          evidence as was before him.” He uses this in reference to a boat that
          is not quite ready to go out to sea but he chose to let it set sail
          anyway because it’s worked every time before. This same thinking can
          lead people to relinquish critical analysis of their own beliefs.
          Sure, this specific way of thinking has worked before but what about
          when it doesn’t? Clifford suggests that it doesn’t matter whether what
          you were taught is right or wrong, but whether you have “insufficient
          evidence.”

        <h3>al-Ghazālī’s Dream Argument for Skepticism</h3>
        <p>
          In the article of al-ghazali's dream argument it talks about
          skepticism. Specifically, it talks about al-ghazali’s journey through
          skepticism and questioning his beliefs. One analogy he uses that
          correlates with indoctrination is the blindness of our sight. He says
          “Sight also looks at a star and sees it as something small, the size
          of a dinar: then geometrical proofs demonstrate that it surpasses the
          earth in size.” Without our judgment, we would believe the sun to be
          the same size as a baseball. However, he also mentions a stance on
          absolutely certainty and doubt free knowledge. The definition he gives
          is “that in which the thing known is made so manifest that no doubt
          clings to it, nor is it accompanied by the possibility of error and
          deception, nor can the mind even suppose such a possibility.”
          Indoctrination is often attributed to a lack of critical thinking
          about knowledge because you were taught to have a firm belief and
          ignore any doubt. What distinctions can be made between knowledge that
          can’t be doubted and knowledge that you don’t doubt?

      <h2>My Position</h2>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <h3>Thoughts</h3>
        <p>
          Logically, I agree with Clifford’s thoughts on “reasonable doubt.”
          Indoctrination can be both good and bad depending on certain
          scenarios. However, if you have a reasonable amount of doubt about a
          subject I believe it is only right for you to think critically about
          your ideologies. That same line of thinking goes into what I think
          about al-ghazali’s thoughts on judgment. The sun being the size of a
          baseball is a ridiculous example, but things that we find so obvious
          now could be the exact reason we refuse to think critically about our
          beliefs. Why do we know it’s not the size of a baseball? We need to
          keep thinking deeply, critically and reason with our views. The moment
          you say “it’s obvious” is the moment you blind yourself to new senses.
          There should be a limit though, I don’t want to teach someone about
          what a “string” is in a programming language and then they constantly
          ask me “why.” This would hinder the process of me sharing my knowledge
          and understanding with someone and also irritate me.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <h3>Counter</h3>
        <p>
          If your student is asking questions, at what point can you say they
          are beyond “reasonable doubt?” Every student is different and may need
          that information to further reinforce their understanding. What you
          might believe is basic knowledge may just be that bit of information
          that your student is lacking.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <h3>Explanation</h3>
        <p>
          It’s true, no matter how much time I spend with a student I will never
          be able to establish a perfect boundary. Therefore, I believe that
          everyone involved should think critically about each of their views.
          This will allow us to dynamically keep ourselves in touch with those
          around us and gauge how much support a student needs. Relating to
          education, indoctrination is most often related to ideologies and
          politics. I believe it’s the teacher’s responsibility to give the
          student as much knowledge as possible about every side so that way
          they can create their own understanding without the teacher as a
          guide. Also, there are more physical constraints that relate to
          education. Sometimes, you don’t have the time and resources that the
          child needs. While different students have varying needs, ultimately
          you can only do your best.
